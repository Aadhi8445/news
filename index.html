      <p style="position: relative;right:60px">Losses have deepened for troubled Maserati, which will not return to profitability before 2020 after its next product offensive starts, executives at parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said.</p>
      <p style="position: relative;right:60px">Maserati posted a 119 million euro ($132 million) loss as it cut production to reduce dealer stocks by 3,000 vehicles and wrote down residual values in the U.S. Those two actions weighed heavily on Maserati during the quarter</p>
      <p style="position: relative;right:60px">On the bright side, Maserati’s Q2 unit sales decline was an improvement on the 32 percent slide during in the first three months of this year and was the brand’s smallest drop in the last 10 quarters. Margins in North America also improved in the second quarter, Manley added.</p>
